# NFLWeddle
Decided to remake the popular Wordle-like game Weddle using python. This way multiple games could be replayed and not just 1 per day. 

The current web game that I got the idea from is https://www.weddlegame.com/ 


Instructions:
The way the game works is that the user is attempting to guess an NFL player which has been randomly pulled from an xlsx file of players. The goal is to guess this player
within the fewest amount of guess attempts. It is similar to the popular game Wordle in that your guess of player will have various fields which will light up
green, yellow, or grey(default color) depending on several factors.
Green means correct. Yellow varies: For position yellow indicates correct side of the ball (offense/defense), while yellow for division means correct conference (AFC/NFC).
For age and number yellow means your guess was too high. Grey(default color) means incorrect or guess was too low.


Feel free to test it out and have fun with it. I would ultimatley like to put this on a website to be playable just like how the actual weddle game is, but do not know
how to go about doing so.
